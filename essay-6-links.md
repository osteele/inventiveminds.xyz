Under the section "Other Suggestions for Cybernetics Projects", Marvin states
that:

> It would take a whole book to begin to discuss the range of new concepts that
> emerged in the 1950s from combining ideas from Psychology, Cybernetics, and
> other sciences.  I don’t see any tidy way to organize this huge body of
> knowledge, so the rest of this paper will only list a number of different
> approaches for this.

Originally, Marvin included the following links.

In an elegant book called _Vehicles_, Valentino Braitenberg explained many
important “Cybernetic” ideas about machines that use various feedback schemes.
Unfortunately, that book is now hard to find, but many computer programs make it
easy to experiment with those ideas: See

There is a large and wonderful collection of intriguing projects on Ken Perlin’s
homepage at <http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/>.

Many more projects are described in _LogoWorks: Challenging Programs in Logo_,
Cynthia Solomon, Margaret Minsky, and Brian Harvey, Eds. McGraw-Hill 1986
(<https://logothings.github.io/logothings/logoworks/Home.html>) and _Computer
Environments for Children: A Reflection on Theories of Learning and Education_,
Cynthia Solomon, MIT Press, 1988). An old but still-relevant introduction to
early research in Artificial Intelligence AI is presented in
<http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/PR1971.html>. Quite a few more
stimulating projects are described by Mitchel Resnick at

* <http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/>, and
* <http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/Clubhouse/Clubhouse.htm>, and
* <http://llk.media.mit.edu/>
